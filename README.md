# lda-hush  
This is a repository for learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which is one of the most famous topic model.  

## Implemente Gibbs LDA in C++  
## Repository Introduction  
> java : The open source java lda code is in this dir. I read this code and rewrite lda in C++.  
> cpp : My c++ code for lda model is in this dir.  
> plda : Another open source lda implementation of LDA model.  

## java  
I did some notes when I read java lda code. The reading note is put in java directory named as README.md, So if you want to know the variables in this code, you can have a look at the README.md in java directory.  

## cpp  
In this directory, I put my cpp code for lda. After I got to understand the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, I read the java lda code first and then I rewrite lda model in c++. This is only a simplication of lda model with gibbs sampling. You can use it as a entry-level introduction for LDA.
